# Common School Map

[Project Link: Leaflet Map of New York City Free and Common Schools](https://zmuhls.github.io/common-school-map/)

This project visualizes the early sites of public education in NYC, tracing the history of free and common schools that laid the groundwork for New York State's public education system. Established in 1805, the New York Free School Society aimed to provide free education to all children in the city. Many of these historical school buildings are now landmarked, repurposed, or vacant. This map represents the first version of a visual history of these important sites on the island of Manhattan.
